        <div class="sec-content-div flexible">
          <p>
            We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
            selling cats and dogs. We know what a good pets looks like and how they
            are grown.Pet animals are defined as animals that are kept for a person's company or for entertainment at home. 
            Pet animals are companions to humans and they are very loyal to their owners. Pet animals are a true example of Teaching us about unconditional love, they also give us instant happiness.
            Our goal is to provide you with the best possible pet.
            Did you know that it has been scientifically proven that stroking an animal can greatly reduce your stress levels? 
            If you spend around 15 minutes petting your favorite cat or dog, your body will release the following natural “feel good” hormones: oxytocin, prolactin and serotonin. 
            It also lowers your cortisol, which is the body’s natural stress hormone. Not only will this send your body into a relaxed state, but it can also lower your blood pressure by 10% too. 
            If you own a dog, then you will have to walk it at least once or twice a day which means you will be getting vital fresh air and exercise while having the opportunity to connect with nature and bond with your four-legged friend.

            <h4>Poodle Puppies 
            </h4>
            <p>
              Poodles are good family dogs — fun, energetic, smart and easy to train.
              They do best with plenty of exercise for both mind and body and prefer to be with people most of the time.

            <h4>Persian Kitten ( Blue Eyes )</h4>
            <p>
              Persian cat personalities are sweet, gentle, and patient.
              They're friendly cats that prefer calm environments but can easily adapt to more active households.

            <h4>Shih Tzu Puppies</h4>
            <p>
              Shih Tzus are beautiful, but they are also friendly, lively, devoted companions. 
              The Shih Tzu personality is enormously appealing, and even grudging dog observers find it hard to resist this breed.

            <h4>Turkish Van Cats</h4>
            <p>
              The breed is rare, is one of the larger breeds, and is distinguished by the Van pattern (named after the breed),
               where the colour is restricted to the head and the tail, and the rest of the cat is white.

            <h4>Golden Retriever Puppies</h4>
            <p>
              Golden retrievers are playful, yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other pets and strangers. 
              These dogs are eager to please, which probably explains why they respond so well to obedience training.

            <h4>Birman Cats</h4>
            <p>
              Birmans are a relatively rare cat breed, so you need to get your name on a waiting list with a registered and reputable breeder as soon as possible.
               Always research Birman breeders before you commit to getting a cat or kitten.
